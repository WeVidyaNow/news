  enjoy: Still enjoy it. Bunch of people to talk to, lots of fun times.

  why: Wanted to play with some people in BF3 General. Playing by myself felt like grinding a single player game with retarded bots.
  enjoy: Most are fine. Some rivalries get annoying though. Much better than playing with pubbies.
