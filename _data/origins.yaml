  why: Wanted to play with some people in BF3 General. Playing by myself felt like grinding a single player game with retarded bots.
  enjoy: Most are fine. Some rivalries get annoying though. Much better than playing with pubbies.

  why: Back around '07 I used to be part of a runescape clan. We did PK (player killing) trips all the time and other events. I had enjoyed being in the community but the game was slowly dying (the group officially stopped PK'ing around 11) and even we were getting bored of grinding in runescape. Many of them left and went to LoL, CoD and others. The original members stuck around (the group is still around today). Some of us added each other on facebook and did irl meet ups (Most of them were midwest/East Coast). I was probably one of the only (if any) that was browsing 4chan at the time. So I decided one day to make my own group and hope to achieve the same things Dan (the clan leader) once did and learn from his mistakes.
  enjoy: Of course, each year the group grows closer and new friends join. Others come and go but whats important is that we've all enjoyed our time here and will continue to do so.

  why: I built my first computer in December of 2011. I didn't have any friends who actually played on the computer, all of them used consoles at the time. Decided to join the Raidcall in the BF3 generals since that was one of the games I was looking forward to playing first.
  enjoy: Yep. There's lots of different people to talk to and plenty of interesting things to do.
