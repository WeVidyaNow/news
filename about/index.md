# Humble Beginnings

On November 21, 2011 the "Tanis Kitchen Group" (a.k.a. Raidcall group) was formed by AnAngryLlama, Luminosity, YUMTUM, BrownieBag, WalterHWhite and Trenkos (couple weeks after). Raidcall was used up until about June or July 2012. Before there was Raidcall there was a friend's Ventrilo server then xfire. We officially switched to RamHost using a private VPS to replace Raidcall with Mumble.

After the Reddit vs. 4chan matches and the end of summer, we switched providers and moved to RamNode which was exceedingly better than RamHost (less downtime, better support, etc). Since then we have continued to employ their services and have bought several more nodes from them. 

Including a number to run silly things such as:

* an imageboard (with WebM support, along with sound and a higher limit than what 4chan allows)
* a rankings board (a homage to Raidcall's crowns)
* <span class="strike">a wiki (then for BF3, now for whatever, <span class="spoiler">might kill it, not sure yet</span>)</span>
* a private mail server (get with me if you want an account)
* and seafile for sharing media.

The Mumble and group in general is far from dead; The group serves as a waypoint for people to join up and do whatever they would like. We have managed to survive for about three years now and continue to collect persons from a variety of locations around the globe.

# Neo BFG

Due to the lack of interest in Battlefield 4 among the regular members, the generals were no longer maintained and continued. This allowed a group to manifest and take over the Battlefield generals with the release of Battlefield 4. 

Most recently the Mumble information was requested to be removed from the generals altogether. The primary reason behind this was due to the lack of new members and poor attitude amongst some of the new members. It was decided amongst the proprietors of the group to simply remove the information.

# "You don't own your own server"

The request to have the server information removed was successful, however, some individuals did not take this as peacefully as others. The [original thread](http://archive.foolz.us/vg/thread/60128106/#60215995) (and post) can explain it all.

One such post by an anonymous poster made it readily apparent that we have no need for them any longer:

> Literally who? who are these people. 

# FREE

The platoon "Freedom Fighters" was created shortly after the Reddit vs. 4chan matches. Its members were comprised of the current Raidcall regulars and people in the matches. The purpose of the platoon was a joke, the platoon presentation makes this readily apparent:

> Freedom Freedom Freedom
> 
> Terrorists Jesus
> 
> Atheists

With the release of platoons in Battlefield 4 the platoon was recreated, this time for Mumble regulars instead.

Neo BFG somehow has confused the platoon and its members for a rogue group that has "taken over" the Mumble server. This is not the case, this has never been the case. It is still the same group that formed the original platoon in Battlefield 3. **Yes, they are that Neo.**

Whether or not they truly believed this is unknown, however, it is still just as hilarious.

# Stars and Stripes

Due to one particular individual the owners for one official server began to up their moderation. Eventually posts were made on their public forum concerning both the Freedom Fighters and Battlefield General platoons and balance issues. After some posts made by "AGuy123" on their forums and a comment by a Freedom Fighters member in their server they finally decided to Punkbuster Ban incoming Freedom Fighters and Battlefield General members from their official server. 

Lastly their leader(s) made [several long comments]({{ site.url }}/assets/bf4-sas-rebuttal.png) on the public page of Freedom Fighters, a long winded reply was made, but received no reaction. It is assumed to this day that they are still ass blasted.

# Reality of the Situation

The majority of people in the group do not care about the generals or the platoons of members from them. They are welcome to join the group regardless of where they came from. However overly obnoxious people will cause friction among the existing population <span class="spoiler">(take note Samuel)</span> which might provoke an administrative response.

# Miscellaneous Factoids

1. We used to own and operate a Battlefield 3 64 slot server, which was hardly used. However, on occasion a mod Invisibro would create a sticky on /v/ to attract people to play. Eventually it was shutdown due to lack of attention. Moot iirc joined the Raidcall at one point to play.
2. We also owned and operated a Battlefield 4 server, first for 24 slots. No one joined except one day we managed to get some people from the generals to join for a bit. It died then another was purchased this time 10 slots. Was used more among the group for fun little games amongst ourselves. On both occasions when the server died no one said a thing, yet people in the generals often say they would "love to have a server for the group". Yet it almost always will remain empty. Moral of the story: Don't buy servers unless you have a group that will actually play on them, you're wasting your money if you don't.
	* See BFG Mumble that died after two months <span class="spoiler">no</span> use.
	* They have started another supposedly for three months, it will be just as inactive as before.
