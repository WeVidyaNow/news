# Humble Beginnings

On November 21, 2011 the "Tanis Kitchen Group" (a.k.a. Raidcall group) was formed by AnAngryLlama, Luminosity, YUMTUM, BrownieBag, WalterHWhite and Trenkos (couple weeks after). Raidcall was used up until about June or July 2012. Before there was Raidcall there was a friend's Ventrilo server then xfire. We officially switched to RamHost using a private VPS to replace Raidcall with Mumble.

After the Reddit vs. 4chan matches and the end of summer, we switched providers and moved to RamNode which was exceedingly better than RamHost (less downtime, better support, etc). Since then we have continued to employ their services and have bought several more nodes from them. 

Including a number to run silly things such as:

* an imageboard (with WebM support, along with sound and a higher limit than what 4chan allows)
* a rankings board (a homage to Raidcall's crowns)
* a wiki (then for BF3, now for whatever)
* a private mail server (get with me if you want an account)
* and seafile for sharing media.

The Mumble and group in general is far from dead; The group serves as a waypoint for people to join up and do whatever they would like. We have managed to survive for about three years now and continue to collect persons from a variety of locations around the globe.

# Neo BFG

Due to the lack of interest in Battlefield 4 among the regular members, the generals were no longer maintained and continued. This allowed a group to manifest and take over the Battlefield generals with the release of Battlefield 4. 

Most recently the Mumble information was requested to be removed from the generals altogether. The primary reason behind this was due to the lack of new members and poor attitude amongst some of the new members. It was decided amongst the proprietors of the group to simply remove the information.

# "You don't own your own server"


The request to have the server information removed was successful, however, some individuals did not take this as peacefully as others. The [original thread](http://archive.foolz.us/vg/thread/60128106/#60215995) (and post) can explain it all.

One such post by an anonymous poster makes it readily apparent that we have no need for them any longer:

> Literally who? who are these people.
