We are **WeVidyaNow** and "we sometimes play games then complain about them."

On November 21, 2011 the "Tanis Kitchen Group" (a.k.a. Raidcall group) was formed by AnAngryLlama, Luminosity, YUMTUM, BrownieBag, WalterHWhite and Trenkos (couple weeks after). Raidcall was used up until about June or July 2012. Before there was Raidcall there was a friend's Ventrilo server then xfire. We officially switched to RamHost using a private VPS to replace Raidcall with Mumble.

After the Reddit vs. 4chan match and the end of summer, we switched providers and moved to RamNode which was exceedingly better than RamHost (less downtime, better support, etc). Since then we have continued to employ their services and have bought several more nodes from them. Including a number to run silly things such as an imageboard (with WebM support, along with sound and a higher limit than what 4chan allows), a rankings board (a homage to Raidcall's crowns), a wiki (then for BF3, now for whatever), and sharing media. More is to come.

We have managed to survive for about three years now and continue to collect persons from a variety of locations around the globe.
