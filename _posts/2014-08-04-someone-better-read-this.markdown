I managed to put together a simple layout and some junk with Bootstrap for our "News & Updates" log. However, for a few weeks or months you should consider this log to be under constant tweaking. I am still learning Bootstrap and eventually need to figure out how to get browsing by category working with Jekyll, along with possibly pagination. In the meantime I want to be a little more transparent about what I actually do on occasion, might post some things I have fixed or keep you posted on minor issues. In the event of outages planned or not I will not only post them on Github (which will publish it here as well), but also publish them on the Steam group to help prevent panic.

I am also going to publish this to Github as a repository under our [organization](https://github.com/WeVidyaNow) so that those of us that have something to announce can actually do so (and maybe people can catch my mistakes). It will also make it easier for me to create articles wherever I may be.

So far I have finished a decent amount of what I wanted to do for some time. Some of it was quick and painless, a couple items were a bit more laborious:

* Self signed SSL certificates for portal and seafile.
* Seafile setup and working (loads more accessible and more utility).
* [The Noseless](//wevidyanow.com/bans.php) a.k.a. Mumble bans page. Updates every 15 minutes (it should).
* Wiki setup, notably for shits and giggles (again) since one of our servers is not getting enough love, so we might as well give it some attention.
* Mail server setup. Though, this was working all along, however, it needed some updates done, tweaking, and depending on how many people actually want to use it I may or may not have to upgrade the plan for it. I also need to come up with a more convienient way of adding users. Doing it by hand sucks.
* Some various updates, automation and whatnot done. Cleaned up some other junk too. Trying to take our collection of servers and secure them. Eventually going to setup some nifty shit to help me keep track of logs.

Next I wanted to give a shot at:

* Redo the Rankings CSS and just use Bootstrap. Not only will it be easier, but the website will be much more responsive.
* Some Minecraft related management and listing things (more of a personal project).
* Need to add the nginx module to munin for graph output.
* Setup Seafile server with mail server to allow reset of passwords and etc.

As far as the Wiki and Seafile server registration is concerned, if you want in just talk to me. Seafile will allow you to register your account, however, it will remain inactive until I manually approve it. Once the mail server is successfully linked with the Seafile server everything should be much quicker, both approval and you can reset your passwords (hint: use a real email, or use an email with @wevidyanow.com for future use; I cannot reset your email manually, Seafile instead sends you a reset link in the email).

The Wiki is the same setup. You can register, but I manually have to activate your account. The email hookup with it will allow some interesting features, such as watching topics and allowing you to reset your password, nothing more unfortunately.

Lastly, since I still got some cash in my Steam account I was honestly thinking of doing a small raffle of some sort, or perhaps a contest for ~$10 worth of junk. Maybe a game of Counter-Strike or something that we can moderate, winner's would get a key or something simple. Just a thought.

That's it for now.
