I reset the VPS with Seafile on it to upgrade it and just in general fix a number of issues. It is now on v4.0.1, has new sharing features, email works again. Everything is working.

Just be sure to whitelist the domain 'wevidyanow.com' or 'ms.wevidyanow.com' (preferably both or just use '\*.wevidyanow.\*') if you're using uBlock or Adblock (or noscript) to prevent issues with sharing.
