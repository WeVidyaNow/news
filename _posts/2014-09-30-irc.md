I've decided to shut the forums down and instead reintroduce the IRC. Since IRC you can share files more or less and there's a some nice plugins for Minecraft for chatting both ways, I think it'd be a nice addition. Not to mention it frees up that VPS for other uses.

Join through circlejerk.wevidyanow.com on **#lounge** or **#minecraft** if in-game.
