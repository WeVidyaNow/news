title: "Our Own Twitch?"

Due to some interest by Username, I'm going to give a look into perhaps running our own little streaming service with nginx. Nginx has a third party RTMP module that allows not only people to stream to it, but also view the streams (including some nice features like recording the stream and transcoding).

If I can set it up and test it a bit on my home network and everything works out fine along with a proper way to authorize streamers I'll go ahead and set it up on a new VPS.

Also Username made us a logo, pretty damn great if you ask me. He's touching it up right now.
