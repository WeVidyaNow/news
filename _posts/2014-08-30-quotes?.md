In a recent burst of activity I decided to take note from a couple of other websites with a simple way to donate without Paypal and manual payment processing.

Introducing the ["Quotes"](http://wevidyanow.com:7000/) repository (URL is temporary until I finalize some things). Instead of paying me directly and getting nothing in return, you can at any time purchase and submit a quote.

You'll be happy to know that I do not handle any of the payment processing, instead Stripe handles it. So, no, I don't have your CC details.

Once I finalize it, I'll give it a proper path at wevidyanow.com/quote.

As always, if there are issues, hangups, etc let me know at admin@wevidyanow.com, Steam, or Mumble.
