Off and on this week and the next I'm going to be working on Circlejerk. Primarily redoing the CSS for the default theme and also working on creating both a new homepage that will include the board list as well as recent/popular posts. Not to mention a FAQ and Rules page.

Might take a bit as it's been awhile since I've used PHP and there's little documentation on theme building for Tinyboard.
