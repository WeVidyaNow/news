For shits and giggles I went ahead and setup both an official account for both [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/wevidyanowofficial/) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDd3DmN_Xrm5yjuye2KxHSQ).

I noticed that both allow you to add people and give permission to others to stream and upload, if you would like permissions to do so email me at [twitch@wevidyanow.com](mailto:twitch@wevidyanow.com) or [youtube@wevidyanow.com](youtube@wevidyanow.com) with the email you use primarily, who you are in Mumble and I go ahead and add you once I verify all that.
