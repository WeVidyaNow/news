I installed a new SSL certificate from a CA. SSL works on Chrome right away, however it'll take a few hours to kick in for Firefox as it uses a separate service to verify certificate authenticity. You can disable this feature under **Preferences > Advanced > Validation** and uncheck the OSCP deal. Though I would not recommend that.
