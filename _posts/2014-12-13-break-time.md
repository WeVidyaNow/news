I'm finished with classes until Jan 12th. During the break I plan to do some spring cleaning on our servers and maybe move some services around that we don't use anymore or at the very leasy try to consolidate them onto the appropriate servers.

I'd like to fix up our game servers so they update properly, create a simple file host, steam server listing and use the info from the steam deal to start over with making the minecraft server listing.

However, all of this is held off for a bit until I finish my fucking around time.
