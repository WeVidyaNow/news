I haven't updated this in a bit, I intend to change that since I have about a week to get some things done.

* I want to go ahead and update some junk. I want to rework the Rankings leaderboard to use Peewee and Redis for caching, lastly, implement the ability to view avatars. Maybe a little doodad to see who's actually online at the moment too.
* I am going to take down the Quotes application and rework it the same way, use Peewee, fix some glaring problems, etc.
* Try to get cunter-strike ready for use.
* I'd like to make something better for us to submit origin stories, I'll see about that, not to mention make it not look like crap.

That's about it, first two items shouldn't take long at all considering the groundwork is done and they already work. Reworking them to use the Peewee ORM shouldn't be hard at all. I forsee the Rankings deal with the avatars possibly being a little difficult, but regardless it'll get fixed up.

I might even just make the Quotes deal free so people use it, why not, might be fun!
