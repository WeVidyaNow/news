Along with attempting to create the news and recent posts plugin for Tinyboard I'm going to also work on the RTMP streaming application. I'm going to try a couple solutions: first being Python & Flask, the other having the authorization done via PHP, but users manage through Python & Flask application. Regardless I'm going to use SQLite due to how few people will be expected to use it.
