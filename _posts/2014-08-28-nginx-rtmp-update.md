For the RTMP streaming deal I'm going to have you submit an email address more than likely for both recovering your account password and eventually might implement some other functionality that people might find useful, such as emailing you when a user goes live or etc.

I initially wanted to use a PIN number and have an optional email address, but it just seems simpler to just use an email address for account management as I'd only have to create and maintain one system for changing account credentials. It will also give me a mode of communication with members. 

Not to mention I can use our mail server to do all of this so it would be sent from an official "@wevidyanow.com" address.
