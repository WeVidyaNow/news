Added a [section](/mail) for how to use and signup for mail address. It is still on a "ask me for an account" basis which honestly seems the best way right now. Public registration just does not seem like a smart idea. I don't have the technical specifications on the VPS for it and do not have the time nor tools to moderate it well.

Oh, if a couple peeps throw in $5 for a total of $20-30 I can upgrade the plan and put back on the virus and spam scanning features. Not necessary, but nice to have. Greylisting on its own seems to work pretty damn well.

Maybe in the future I will, but for now just get with me and I'll set you up.
