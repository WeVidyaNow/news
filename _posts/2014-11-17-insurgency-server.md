Since I was tired of dealing with shitty Insurgency cooperative servers that won't let you vote to change map or do stupid shit, I went ahead and created out own. Read the PTSD mumble channel comment for more information. By default it runs cooperative with a slightly higher base supply so you can actually setup your weaponry.
