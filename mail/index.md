# How do I get one?

Either email me at [contact@wevidyanow.com](mailto:contact@wevidyanow.com) or talk to me through Mumble, Steam, etc. I will create an account for you and forward you the details.

# What are the limits? Restrictions? ToS?

Unless I let you know otherwise, your account has a 1 GB quota. Depending on how many people use it I may reduce or increase this.

I do not necessarily care what you do with the account, but:

* Don't spam people, it's an easy way for it to get put on a blacklist of sorts.
* No illegal media.

Other than that go nuts.

# What kind of features does it have?

Last I checked it is loaded with:

* Greylisting support
* <span class="strike">Spam detection</span> (disabled due to high RAM requirements)
* <span class="strike">Virus scanning</span> (disabled due to high RAM requirements)

If some people pitch in about $20-30 I can upgrade it to the next plan which will allow me to re-enable some of the neater features. However greylisting seems to do a good job. Out of the entire two years I have had it running, I think I have gotten a total of <strong>ten</strong> emails that were spam.

The web interface can be located at [mail.wevidyanow.com](https://mail.wevidyanow.com/mail).
